## autumo ifaceX Developer Project 1.2.0 - Developer Reference

This is a maven eclipse project and serves as a developer reference when 
extending the autumo ifaceX platform programmatically. If you have acquired
an enterprise license of autumo ifaceX you also have access to the Developer
Reference Manual.

If you want to install the project properly, you need the Maven console
tools installed on your computer (e.g. command 'mvn') and a local Maven
repository.

Of course, you can also just look at the source files and use what you need
in your own project and IDE.

### Install:

1.	You can import the project in eclipse or in any other development IDE.

2.	Copy the following libraries from the ifaceX Installation directory
	into the 'lib/'-directory of this project:
	
	- lib/autumo-commons-x.y.z.jar
	- lib/autumo-ifacex-x.y.z.jar
	- lib/autumo-beetroot-x.y.z.jar

3.	Execute 'maven-install.sh|bat' so above libraries are installed into 
	your local Maven repository; only available with autumo ifaceX, see
	https://products.autumo.ch.
